User Story: 
As a student, I want to practice my understanding of spoken words in the language I am learning, I want a listening comprehension mode. I want this because I will be able to learn the language better by hearing the words. 

TDD Examples:
1. The visible state of the screen will resemble that of any of the other games. However, the one and only difference is that instead of words, the grid will be filled in with numbers ranging from 1 - 4, 6, 9 or 12 depending on the board size chosen. Each of the numbers correlates directly with one of the words in the word bank.
2. The user action to implement this user story is that they will be able to click on any of the already filled-in words in the grid.
3. The system's response to this action is to play a pre-recorded audio clip of the word corresponding to the number they clicked. For example, if the user decides to click on the number 2 in the grid where the number 2 correlates to the French word “Pomme”, an audio recording of the word “Pomme” being said will be played.

Other game board sizes will adjust the diagram accordingly.
